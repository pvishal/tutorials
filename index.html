This site is going to a loose collection of tutorials I have given on fundamentals of SLAM. The pages of this site will simply be the Jupyter notebooks I used in those 
tutorials that are converted to pages with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).

[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  A full list of features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).
